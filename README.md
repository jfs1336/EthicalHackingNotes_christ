I am taking **#100 days of CYBERSERCURITY** challenge!
[Day1] My first day in the #100 days of CYBERSECURITY started with me sitting alone in the first, ok the second row all alone and facing my laptop and opening the virtual machine with full confindence that i have it all.
Sir was checking from his tab to know the number of people who forked to the git acc and it was less than the third of class and i am happy i was among the people who forked it .
Sir then started asking us to know who all have installed kali linux and virtual machine . And me being me with full confidence that i have done every thing right was sitting while he was telling other to install.
After seeing how good we are in downloading things from google he lost his hopes and showed us how to download it from the scrap and i was still sitting as if i have done every thing right.
He showd how to download the virtual box from oracle which i did right cause both his and my screen had the same setting so i was chill , But then came the disaster he went to kali linux and downloaded the virtual machine package.
And why i it was  a disaster? cause i downloaded the installer version i freaked out but still maintained the cool nature and for a double check i asked my people beside me about it and they said i have donwloaded the wronge vwersion.
BUT me being me still extratced it  cause again why not and after doing it and seeing that i wont run i understood that i am in a trouble .So i wemt to the site agina to download the correct version only to frekaout agian.
It was freaking 3.3 GB and my moblie data was like 500 mb left and that moment sir came and asked me id everything ok in my system i said yes really bold thing and asked him a doubt . 
whats the diffrence between installer and virtual machine ? well a way to escape but he did answered to my question and i unbderstood that it is bascally used to run multiple OS in the same physical system.
And he asked me a question  and that was wheather i was the CR of the class i said "yes i an he CR  of 3BTIT  but not of this class since it is a combined class of people from diffrent domians" well my blazzer did  helped i guess.
After he went i aske my people what to do and they said dont worry they have a pendrive from which i can download kali . Oh GOD  the relife  got after it was insane . I inserted thew drive ot my laptop and started downloading it.
Well it did showed up in my system and i started extracting it but it  was taking alot of time like a really and exctacting speed depends on the system proccessor and here i am pumbing with and intel i7 i was  wondersing why.
And the same person who gave me the drive i am extracting it to the same pendrive not otm y system well thats stupid of me and after alot of talk i did exttracted it ot my system and it worked well but there was a new problem .
My linux is not running in my vm i dont know why i tired alot in class it didnt worked and the class got over so i decided to go home and do it which  i did the issue was my vdm file was not working so i reinstalled everything and it worked.
Well thats my first day of **#100 days of CYBERSECURITY** WELL  it did started rought but whaats the fun if everything goes according to the plan well i hope for new challenges and understand the world of cybersecurity better
As i say lets keep is SAFE!!.
[DAY2] The day 2 of **#100 days  of cybersecurity started with sir explaning about the various use of linux and how kali linux can be used to work with diffrent commands.
We learned pwd ls chmode rmdri rkfri etc functions as a beiging .
In the next cycle we learned about the how we can bypass windows security and hack our own systems .
We learned about villain frame and how it is used to bypass windows .
We were tasked to hack a wi_fi or a seerver for the next class as an homeork.
And also downloading VS code in the system is another part 
Well i hope to learn better and new things in the up coming sessions and manymore
[DAY3] so another day of cyber security and this time i was attending the class in a diffrent room casue our room was occupied for some other functions and this time my kali linux was working properly with no flaws but my system was not charging which is a huge flaw but it was fine i somw how fixed it .
but there was no vs code which was not a issue this time.
Sir thought us protocols like tcp utp and ftp
tcp  Transmission Control Protocol – ensures reliable, ordered data delivery over networks.
- FTP: File Transfer Protocol – a standard method for transferring files between computers over the internet.
and then we had a small talk about reconasens in computer
and how does a malware actually works from getting transfered to infecting the system
then we had sone fun activity in a website called have i been found to see our mail id has been leaked or not and well mine was not liked so good i guess
well that was a new learning for all of us and me and it was fun hope it will be the same for the next classes too
[day4]
well day 4 was pretty boring since sir was absent and we where doing nothing most us where playing games or studying and i was doing my reasearch in qunataum mech .
well thats how i done my entire 2 hours i know it pretty boring but i hope firsday will be fun
